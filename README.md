## Lot Size Calculation

The `CalculateLotSize` function is responsible for calculating the lot size based on the risk level specified. It uses the account's free margin, risk level, and the margin required for the symbol being traded to determine the appropriate lot size.

## Forex Market Analysis

The `AnalyzeForexMarket` function performs a comprehensive analysis of the forex market. This function should be implemented with the necessary logic to analyze various indicators, patterns, or other factors to make informed trading decisions.

After analyzing the market, the function uses the `OpenBuyOrder` and `OpenSellOrder` functions to place buy and sell orders respectively. These functions require the symbol being traded, the calculated lot size, the current ask or bid price, as well as the desired stop loss and take profit levels.

## Trade Optimization

The `OptimizeTradingStrategy` function is responsible for optimizing the trading strategy employed by the robot. This function should implement various techniques such as parameter optimization, backtesting, or other methods to enhance the trading strategy.

The function uses the `ModifyOrder` function to modify an existing order's stop loss and take profit levels based on the returned order ticket. It also uses the `CloseOrder` function to close an existing order based on the returned order ticket.

## Main Entry Point

The `OnTick` function serves as the main entry point for the robot. It is executed on each tick of the market. Within this function, the code checks if the requirements specified by the PROP firm are met. These requirements include a maximum drawdown per day, overall drawdown, monthly profit, and leverage restrictions.

If the requirements are met, the function proceeds to perform the forex market analysis by calling the `AnalyzeForexMarket` function. It then proceeds to optimize the trading strategy by calling the `OptimizeTradingStrategy` function.
